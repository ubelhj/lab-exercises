# Making vectors and Dataframes

# What could be an issue here?
event_capacity <- c(60, 50, '100', 100)

# Fix the possible error in a new variable event_capacity_new

# Create a vector of event names for each event 
event_names <- 
  
  # Fix the error in creating this dataframe
  events <- data.frame(event_names, event_cost, event_capacity)

# Check the event_capacity column

events$event_capacity

# Try with event_capacity_new column
events <- data.frame(event_names, event_capacity_new)

# Are there any differences between event_capacity and event_capacity)_new?
# Answer here

# Fix an error of adding columns to the dataframe
events.event_attendance <- c(54, 43, 85, 90)

# Add a column called seats_left in the events dataframe
events$seats_left <-
